# Hi there, Matteus here 👋

👨🏻‍💻 I am a fullstack developer with a recent graduation from Medieinstitutet, where I completed my studies with top marks and also wrapped up an internship at Trust Anchor Group where I received strong references for my contributions.

💡 I enjoy building real-world solutions and learning through hands-on projects. I have experience working with MERN stack and Next.js, and while my background is in JavaScript technologies, I am tech-agnostic at heart — always up for learning the right tool for the job.

🚀 I am eager to contribute, grow, and collaborate with others. Feel free to check out some of my projects!
