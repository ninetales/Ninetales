# Hi there, Matteus here ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student at Medieinstitutet, diligently pursuing a career as a Fullstack Developer specializing in MERN-stack and Blockchain. I am always open to explore and work with other programming languages and technologies.

Highly motivated to soak up knowledge and jump into real-world projects. As part of my curriculum, I am required to find an internship as a developer in the beginning of 2025. If this is of interest, don't hesitate in reaching out.
